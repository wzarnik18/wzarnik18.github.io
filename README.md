My GitHub account is brand new. I am learning a lot by playing with the different software options.
I created a new repository with my username as the title of the repository.
To clone the repository, I signed in on the desktop version, then opened the repository page back onto my browser to make some changes to my README.md file, and now I am making the changes on Google Chrome.
